Disables all the ESLint rules that have an **equivalent and recommended** Biome rule, so you can use both for better performance.

Early stage lib, will be improved soon with further improvements such as considering non-recommended Biome rules.

## üíø Installation

```bash
npm install -D eslint-plugin-biome
```

- `.eslintrc.*`: Add `"biome"` as the last item in the `extends` field.

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "other-configs",
    "biome"
  ]
}
```

- `eslint.config.js`: Import `eslint-config-biome` and have it as the last item in the configuration array

```js
import eslintConfigBiome from "eslint-config-biome";

export default [
  otherConfigs,
  eslintConfigBiome,
];
```

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info

- In your .eslintrc, you can instead have this in `overrides`:

```
overrides: [{
  files: ["*.ts", "*.js", "*.tsx", "*.jsx"],
  extends: ["biome"],
}],
```

Being this the last item in the array, this will make sure that other existing overrides before it will have this patch applied. This also overrides any rules that may lie in the root of your .eslintrc under `rules`.

- You should use it together with [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) so formatting rules are also disabled as Biome has almost a 100% compatibility with prettier! You certainly no longer require prettier if you are using Biome.

- In VSCode, to apply Biome and ESLint on save, you should have these in your settings.json:

```json
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
  "source.fixAll.eslint": "explicit",
  "source.organizeImports.biome": "explicit",
  "quickfix.biome": "explicit"
},
"editor.defaultFormatter": "biomejs.biome"
```
